# Godot easy Finite State Machine - a new way to machine! :)

This is an example project with my state machine logic. All the assets included are findable for free on itch.io.

Godot eFSM is a very simple but useful state machine logic. It works fine and keep your code splitted in many nodes.

The structure provide a States nodes children of the Player (or of the enemies) that manage any single state with its own script attached.
